      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>No matter whether you’re gunning for that elusive eight-pack or just want to bolster your core, it’s likely lower ab workouts are the missing link in your training arsenal. Though just one muscle – the rectus abdominis – runs down your
                    abdomen, most abs movements primarily activate the ‘upper’ section, making your otherwise impressive rig a little top-heavy in terms of strength. <br>Not only are lower abs tricky to target, they’re even harder to show off. Your body
                    is predisposed to storing excess fat in that area – from an evolutionary standpoint, belly fat is part of your body’s energy stockpiling system – so making those muscles pop takes serious dedication (and mostly comes down to your diet).
                    However, there’s more than a washboard stomach at stake. Your body may be a temple, but it’s also pretty lazy when left to its own devices. If part of your core is weak, other body parts will be recruited to burden the load, not just
                    in the gym but during everyday activities like sitting at your desk or driving. If your lower abs are lacking, ultimately your back and hips will pay the price. <br>“Due to our modern lifestyle, a large percentage of the population
                    suffer from an anterior pelvic tilt; where your pelvis is rotated forward, forcing your spine to curve,” explains Tom Donaldson, head coach at Orangetheory Fitness Wandsworth. Strengthening your core helps bring your pelvis back into
                    a neutral position, he says, improving your posture in the process. This is important since dynamic posture, which is how you hold yourself as you move, has a direct impact on your athletic performance. “In order to generate the maximum
                    amount of power with the upper and lower body, the pelvis and spine needs to be stable,” Donaldson continues. “This stability is achieved when the core muscles and glutes are strong and highly functioning. This is particularly important
                    for anyone who plays sports and will allow athletes to lift heavier weights, run at a faster speed and change direction quicker.”</p>

                        <li>Heel Tap Crunch</li>

                        <p class="paragraph"><br> Why: This exercise predominantly targets the lower abs, obliques and hip flexors, Juniper explains, and can be made harder or easier by adjusting the distance between your heels and glutes. Don’t worry about speed, by the
                            way. Controlling the movement is way more effective than looking like wacky waving inflatable arm-flailing tube man. <br> <br> How: Lie on your back with your heels near your glutes. - Brace your core, lift your shoulders off
                            the floor and reach down to touch your right heel with your right hand, then your left heel with your other hand. That's one rep.</p>

                        <li>Mountain Climbers</li>
                        <p class="paragraph"><br> Why: To really double down on your lower abs, make the movement slow and controlled, suggests Donaldson. “Imagine you have a glass of water balanced on your lower back to keep your hips and spine as still and level as possible
                            throughout the movement.” <br> <br> How: Set up on the floor as though in a sprinter's blocks, with one foot positioned beneath your waist and one back, with your leg straight. - Shoulders should be stacked in line with your
                            hands placed on the floor and your body should maintain a neutral plank position throughout. Swap foot positions.</p>

                        <li>Side Plank</li>
                        <p class="paragraph"><br>Why: “A side plank doesn’t just target the transverse abdominal muscles and obliques – it’s also great for the glutes, quads and hamstrings,” says Juniper. Challenge yourself by raising your upper leg or arm.

                            <br><br> How: Lie on your left side with your knees straight and prop your upper body up to take its weight on your forearm. - Brace your core and raise your hips until your body forms a straight line. Hold this position while
                            breathing deeply. Then roll over and repeat on the other side.

                        <li>Reverse Crunch
                        </li>
                        <p class="paragraph"><br>Why: This exercise really challenges your rectus abdominis, says Juniper. Want to set your six-pack on fire? Incorporate resistance bands or a cable machine.

                            <br><br> How: Lie on your back with your arms on the floor at your sides, palms facing down. - Bend your knees and bring them towards your chest by contracting your abs. As they rise, roll your pelvis to lift your hips off
                            the floor. - Squeeze at the top then slowly lower until your thighs are perpendicular to the floor. </p>

                        <li>Medicine Ball Jackknife</li>
                        <p class="paragraph"><br>Why: “I love this exercise because you can feel the burn straight away,” says Juniper. “It works nearly 12 muscles in the body mainly targeting the rectus abdominis.” For an extra push, try to keep your feet off the ground
                            between reps, she adds.

                            <br><br> How: Grab a medicine ball and lie down on your back holding the ball over your head. Your arms and legs should be outstretched with your hands and feet lifted just above the floor. - Begin the exercise by simultaneously
                            raising your torso and legs up to touch the medicine ball to your feet. Then slowly lower back towards the floor. That's one rep. </p>
