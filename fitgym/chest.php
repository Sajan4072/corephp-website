        <div class="lead">
            <div class="text-justify">
                <p>For most men, a chest workout centres around three moves: a bench press completed in the flat, incline and decline positions, but there are so many chest exercises and workouts to try, there's really no need for chest day to be so boring.
                    In other words, we want you to be better than the bench press, but why should you expand your repertoire of chest exercises? Well, hitting you chest for more angles than the humble bench allows will result in a bigger, stronger chest,
                    and having a bigger chest will (obviously) make you more adept at pushing heavy objects — from barbells to broken-down cars. But it's not all about strength, concentrating on chest exercises and workouts will also encourage better
                    posture, as well as making you look taller by adding height to your chest wall. Moreover, a bigger chest just looks impressive, and not just to us. A study published in Plos One found that women's, as well as men's, perception of the
                    ideal male body included a muscular, wide chest circumference that creates an overall V-shaped torso. Convinced? We thought you might be, so, whether you're at home or in the gym, here are the chest exercise and workouts you need to
                    develop serious pecs appeal.</p>

                        <li>Dumbbell Squeeze Press</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br> Why: Squeezing the dumbbells together during a chest press moves the emphasis of the movement onto your pecs. This simple tweak engages them throughout the entire range of motion — a key factor to maximise muscle gain. <br><br>                            How: Lie on a flat bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Maintain a neutral grip and begin with your arms straight, directly above you. Bend your arms and lower them to the side of your body so the dumbbells lie just above
                            your chest. Pause and then lift your arms to repeat.</p>

                        <li>Incline barbell bench press</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br> Why: Pressing on an incline set-up works the clavicular head, which is why the incline barbell bench press makes your pecs pop. <br> <br> How: Lie back on a bench set to an incline angle and lift a barbell to shoulder height,
                            palms facing away from you. Breathe out as you press up with both arms. Lock out your arms and squeeze your chest before returning slowly to the start position.</p>

                        <li>Incline dumbbell bench press</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Why: While the bench press is the chest-bulking staple, dumbbell presses offer different variants to help you build a bigger chest. By using two separate weights, you have a greater range of motion, while activating more stabilising
                            muscles too. To make it harder, Take the weight all the way to the top of the movement before lowering the opposite side to keep your chest under tension.

                            <br><br> How: Lie back on a bench set to a 45-degree angle and lift the weights over your chest, palms facing away from you. Slowly lower one weight, then drive it back up and squeeze your chest at the top.Repeat with the other
                            side.

                        <li>Close-grip barbell bench press</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Why: The close-grip bench press places less strain on your shoulders, shifting the emphasis to your triceps and chest. Place your hands just inside of shoulder width.

                            <br><br> How: Lie back on a flat bench holding a barbell with a narrow, overhand grip. From the starting position, breathe in and lower the bar slowly until it skims the middle of your chest. Push the bar back to the starting
                            position explosively as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. </p>

                        <li>Decline press-up</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Why: Decline bench press-ups place the muscle-building emphasis on your lower pectorals, helping you build a well-rounded and more defined chest.

                            <br><br> How: Place your feet on a bench with your hands planted on the floor in front of you. Lower your body down until your chest almost reaches the floor. Press your body back up to the starting position while squeezing
                            your chest. Pause briefly at the top before repeating. </p>

                        <li>Cable fly</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Why: Give your pectorals and deltoids a new stimulus instead of pressing. Add the cable fly to your chest day to provide constant tension throughout the full movement.

                            <br><br>How: Attach stirrup handles to the high pulleys of a cable crossover machine. Take one in each hand – your arms should be outstretched with a slight bend. Place one foot slightly forward, brace your core, and pull the
                            handles downward and across your body. Return to the start position under control

                        <li>Decline barbell bench press</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Why: Using a decline bench helps zero-in on your lower chest, helping you build serious size on your chest.

                            <br><br> How: Holding a barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart and palms facing your feet, lie back on a bench fixed to a decline setting. Start with your arms fully extended and hands over your chest, then lower the
                            bar slowly until it skims the middle of your chest. Push the barbell back to the starting position explosively as you breathe out.

                        <li>Staggered press-up</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Why: If you've already mastered press-ups, then this is an ideal stepping-stone into mastering the one-handed press-up.

                            <br><br> How: Get into a press-up position with your hands staggered, so your right is further forward then the left. Lower your body until your chest is an inch from the ground then drive up explosively. Pull your hands off
                            the floor and switch positions so your left leads, then repeat.

                        <li>Chest dips</li>
                        <p class="lead"><br>Why: If you want to burn chest fat and lose your man boobs, dips are one of the best ways to go about it. Working the entire upper-body, dips also work your arms, shoulders and upper back. As you descend, you'll be fighting
                            to stabilise your entire body as it moves through space, giving your body a huge hormonal boost.

                            <br><br> How: Grab the bars of a dip station with your palms facing inward and your arms straight. Slowly lower until your elbows are at right angles, ensuring they stay tucked against your body and don't flare out. Drive yourself
                            back up to the top and repeat. </p>

                            <br><br>How: Get into a push-up position, your hands just outside your chest, your feet shoulder-width apart, and your body forming a straight line from head to heels. Brace your core. Lower your chest to the floor and then
                            press up explosively so your hands come off the floor, clapping once at the top of the movement. </p>
